## Introducing Data Analysis

### Manipulate Raw Data

By definition, _raw data_ is a mere collection of facts that by themselves tell you little or nothing.

### Data

-   Data Entry
-   Imported Data
-   Table

    If you convert the range into a table, Excel treats the data as a simple flat file database and enables you to apply a number of database-specific analysis techniques to the table.

### Data Models

A _data model_ is a collection of cells designed as a worksheet version of some real-world concept or scenario.

#### Formulas

A _formula_ is a set of symbols and values that perform some kind of calculation and produce a result.

#### Functions

A _function_ is a predefined formula that is built in to Excel. Each function takes one or more inputs called _arguments_, such as numbers or cell references, and then returns a result.

### What-If Analysis

One of the most common data analysis techniques is _what-if analysis_, where you set up worksheet models to analyze hypothentical situations.

#### Data Tables

A _data table_ is a range of cells where one column consists of a series of values, called _input cells_. You can then apply each of the inputs to a single formula, and E xcel displays the results for each case.

#### Goal Seek

You use the Goal Seek tool in Excel when you want to manipulate one formula component, called the _changing cell_, in such a way that the formula produces a specific result. For example, in a _break even analysis_, you can use Goal Seek to determine the number of units of a product that you must sell for the profit to be 0.

#### Solver

You use the Solver tool in E xcel when you want to manipulate multiple formula components, called the _changing cells_, in such a way that the formula produces the optimal result.

#### Scenarios

A _scenario_ is a collection of input values that you plug into formulas within a model to produce a result. The idea is that you make up scenarios for various situations -- for example, best-case, worst-case, and so on -- and the Excel Scenario Manager saves each one. Later you can apply any of the saved scenarios, and E Xcel automatically applies all the input values to the model.
